# SocialNetworkingApplication-
In this project, you are going to develop a social networking application implementing  client and server modules. (i) The Server module manages message transfers, notifications and friendship relationships among the users, and (ii) the Client module behaves as a user which adds/removes friends, accepts/rejects friendship requests, sends/receives messages and receives relevant notifications.  The server listens on a predefined port and accepts incoming client connections. There might be one or more clients connected to the server at the same time. Each client knows the IP address and the listening port of the server (to be entered through the Graphical User Interface (GUI)). Clients connect to the server on a corresponding port and identify themselves with their names. Server needs to keep the names of currently connected clients in order to avoid the same name to be connected more than once at a given time to the server.   On the server side, there is a predefined database of users which are presumed to be registered to the social network so that you do not need to implement any registration process between a client and the server. That user database has actually been provided you together with this document. A client, whose name should be in the user database, will be able to connect by providing his/her name only (no password or other type of security). Once connected, he/she will act as mentioned in the homework file.
